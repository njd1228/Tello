        Hi! I'm Nick. I built Track-TV.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        I spent countless nights after work binge watching
        some of my favorite TV shows, but I was always looking 
        for the next one to watch.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        Finding something to watch was tricky, though. Unless we binge-watch a
        series, it's hard to remember where we left off when we return to it.
        Worse, sometimes I'd totally forget that a great show even existed;
        months after a season ends, how do you remember to check to see if there
        are new episodes?
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        I tried some of the existing options but found that they were bloated
        overcomplicated. I wanted a quick, fun way to check what shows were
        available for me to watch, and nothing I found did the trick.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        As a software developer and semi-competent designer, I realized that
        this was a problem I could solve, and Track-TV was built!{' '}

      <Paragraph size="large">
        This was a school final project for the University Of Central 
        Florida's Full-Stack Coding BootCamp so I had limited time to 
        get things together and borrowed a lot of ideas on how to set 
        things up with react and passport so I will be continuously
        adding to the site to make it better!
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        The goal of Track-TV is not to become a business, or to make money. It's
        something I wanted to exist, and a good excuse to practice my design/dev
        skills. If, by some miracle, it becomes popular, I may have to introduce
        some monetization, to cover its costs.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        I hope you enjoy Track-TV! If it helps, please{' '}
