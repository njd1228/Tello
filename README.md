A simple and effortless way to track and manage all your favorite TV shows!
I was interested in making this app because of the recent demise of TV Muse and the cancellation of some of my favorite TV Shows after either only one season or multiple and decided to try and develop an application to not just fill the void leftover from TV-Muse, but add something else unique to it.

In the days, weeks and months to come I plan on building my database to get even more information to be able to search for that compares the popularity of shows from the standardized Neilson ratings that are used for live TV ratings to the most watched shows from some of the most popular free streaming sites on the web. We want to find out what is being watched the most and how the online stream presence compares to the network one and how it ultimately effects the shows standing.
